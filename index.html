                            <strong><span>Wow. This day felt incredibly exhausting.</span> I spent all day studying for CSE 101 and I feel so unprepared even though I've went over so many topics.
                            Why does this quiz have to already be worth 7% of our grade? It's only Week 2 and I already feel so stressed -- is this normal? Sometimes I wonder what
                            it would be like to be in a different major. Would it be better for me? I wonder if choosing this major was right for me. Maybe it's the stress talking, 
                            but CS has always been more difficult for me compared to others but I'm doing well so I guess it doesn't matter? I guess I shouldn't compare myself to others.
                            It only will hurt me in the long run. I just need to focus on the task at hand and just do the best I can on this quiz that I have tomorrow. All we can really
                            do in life is our best. And if that's not enough, then that's okay. Things are not always going to go our way, but that's okay. Life always has a way of working
                            things out. </strong>

                            <strong><span>Today was a pretty relaxed day.</span> I kind of feel guilty for taking a break for the day after taking my CSE 101 quiz,
                            but I need to remember that sometimes it's okay to just take a day for yourself. We can't keep grinding 24/7 or else
                            we will just burn out completely. I enjoyed just spending some time to myself and doing something that wasn't school
                            or CS related. Sometimes, I wish that I could enjoy doing CS related things on my free time, but I just really need
                            a break from it. I wonder how some people gain the motivation and drive to spend their free time coding or doing personal projects.
                            I wish I could be like that. But sometimes I really just feel like I want to spend my last remaining moments as a college
                            student in a fun way. I don't want to remember my college experience as me just continually worrying about my future and my career because
                            before I know it, I'll be graduating and working for the rest of my life. It's a sad thought to think about, but I'm hopeful that
                            there will be some good things to happen in the future too.</strong>

                            <strong>I miss enjoying the weekends. I remember when I was in middle or high school when I could actually enjoy the freedom of weekends. Now,
                            the weekends are just a way of catching up or working on the assignments given to you throughout the week. It feels exhausting growing up.
                            I miss being younger where I didn't have to worry about as many things. Now, I always wake up every morning wondering, what do I have to 
                            finish or complete today? I can never just wake up and slowly enjoy my day. But, I guess that's just a part of growing up. It's unfortunate, 
                            but I'm sure there are some pros in growing up too. I'm not too sure on what they are yet, but hopefully I can figure it out soon once 
                            I get back to San Diego in the fall. </strong>
